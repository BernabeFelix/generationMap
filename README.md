Generation Take-Home Coding Challenge
=================================
This is a take-home coding challenge used to help evaluate candidates
interested in joining the team at Generation.
The goal is for candidates to complete the coding challenge before the
in-person interview so that we can discuss the solution together.
In cases where this is not possible, we may discuss the solution together
over a followup phone call.
